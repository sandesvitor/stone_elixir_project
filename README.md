# StoneChallenge

This is an challenge propouse by Stone for its selection process, **Programa de Formação em Elixir**.

As the commands said, I will use integers number, representing the unit scale for monetary currency by *brazilian cents*, or "centavos", being 100 centavos equals to 1 real (R$1,00).

That said, I'll leave the final awnser in *centavos*, to keep the representation of integer numbers unharm.
